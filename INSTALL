How to run on:
1. Linux
2. Windows
3. Mac OS X
4. Wine

1. LINUX

On Debian-based machines, you can simply run install.sh. Alternatively, you can install everything manually as follows.

To run on linux, make sure that you have installed the following packages:

-python

-python-tk

-python-imaging-tk

To install these packages on a Debian-based distro such as Ubuntu, type the following. This will require an administrative password.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python python-tk python-imaging-tk

The python interpreter is assumed to be installed at /usr/bin/python, which should be the default on most Linux distros.

You can run buildcraft by changing into this directory and running the following command.

./buildcraft

You may have to give it executable permissions:

chmod +x buildcraft

We're working to support full installation in the future.

2. WINDOWS
