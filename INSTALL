How to run on:

4. Wine

1. LINUX

On Debian-based machines, it is easiest to install the .deb file from the linux release at https://github.com/projectbuildcraft/buildcraft/tarball/linux. Then, you can just run:
dpkg -i buildcraft<version>.deb
where <version> is specific to the version being installed.

Alternatively, you can install everything manually from source as follows.

To run on linux, make sure that you have installed the following packages, on Debian-based machines named:

-python

-python-tk

-python-imaging-tk

Note that this project runs on python 2.7. The summary of the above requirements is that you need an X server and the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

To install these packages on a Debian-based distro such as Ubuntu, type the following. This will require an administrative password.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python python-tk python-imaging-tk

The python 2.7 interpreter is assumed to be installed at /usr/bin/python, which should be the default on most Linux distros.

You can run buildcraft by changing into this directory and running the following command.

./buildcraft

You may have to give it executable permissions:

chmod +x buildcraft

Assets may have to be copied into /usr/share/games/buildcraft/

We're working to support native installation for other packaging systems in the future. Any assistance would be appreciated.

2. WINDOWS

3. MAC OS X

4. WINE
