List of things that do not fit the normal format:
Zerglings: two are spawned
Archons: two Templars are consumed. We need to make sure any combination of Templar works.
TechLab/Reactor Things: The must be occupiable twice (for an additional unit or for a separate research). Removing the add-on must build two different units. It must be considered the same type of structure as its original version for the purposes of requirements.
Supply Depot Addition: When using the OC calldown, it must be changed to a new type of Supply Depot. Called what?
Salvaging Bunkers: It has to have an event that creates minerals rather than a unit.
Queen/Hatchery Things: A queen must be attached to hatchery, because nobody moves their queens from hatchery to hatchery, and the distance matters.
Creep Tumors: Must both become Used Creep Tumors, and spawn an additional Creep Tumor.
MULE: event gives lots of minerals over time, not all at the end
