List of things that do not fit the normal format:
Zerglings: two are spawned
	Solution: Modify add_unit function such that it takes a list as a parameter. Give two lings.
	Better: Add an add_units function that takes a list as a parameter. Give that one two lings.
Archons: two Templars are consumed. We need to make sure any combination of Templar works.
	Solution: There are 3 distince events for the combination.
TechLab/Reactor Things: The must be occupiable twice (for an additional unit or for a separate research). Removing the add-on must build two different units. It must be considered the same type of structure as its original version for the purposes of requirements.
Supply Depot Addition: When using the OC calldown, it must be changed to a new type of Supply Depot. Called what?
	Suggestion: Double Depot
Salvaging Bunkers: It has to have an event that creates minerals rather than a unit.
	Solution: Add an add_minerals function that takes a number as a parameter.
Queen/Hatchery Things: A queen must be attached to hatchery, because nobody moves their queens from hatchery to hatchery, and the distance matters.
	Suggestion: Make the distance negligible and handle injection as an event that busies the hatchery.
		Resulting issue: Hatcheries can be busied by upgrades in parallel to larvae
Creep Tumors: Must both become Used Creep Tumors, and spawn an additional Creep Tumor.
	Suggestion: a function that does this. Done.
		Or, could just have a cooldown, then spawn a Used Creep Tumor.
MULE: event gives lots of minerals over time, not all at the end
	Suggestion: creation of a mule unit so that minerals can be calculated in the same place. The MULE is destroyed.
Chrono Boost: How will we factor this into event ending time calculations?
Warpgate: Unit appears before building stops being busied.
	This is Cooldown, correct?
